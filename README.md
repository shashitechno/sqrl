**Adding a new feed**

In order to add a new feed you need to know its ID. Page IDs are provided by Facebook Graph. To obtain page's ID follow the following steps:

**Manually:**

1. Visit a Facebook page of your choice
2. Copy it's name. For example, from `https://www.facebook.com/Batman` the name would be `Batman`
3. Navigate to https://graph.facebook.com/PAGE_NAME. In our example: https://graph.facebook.com/Batman
4. In the output find: `"id": "6939574006"`
5. Copy that ID to appropriate field in the plugin page, fill in the fetch limit (and optionally image sizes) and press Create new.

**Automatically, using findmyfbid.in**
- Just visit the site http://findmyfbid.in and provide it with URL of page you wish to get ID of
